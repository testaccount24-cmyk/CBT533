Revision  01/02/05

  VTT2T2FK  -  This is a new program which creates a FAKETAPE (TM)
   1.12        image disk file from any tape input.  Similar in
               function to VTT2DISK, except that the output disk
               file is in FAKETAPE format instead of AWS format.

Revision  12/30/04

  VTT2DISK  -  Fixed the program logic to be able to create an AWS
   1.12        tape file with any size chunks, up to 65535 bytes
               (which is the default).  The chunk size can be changed
               either at assembly time by changing a global variable,
               or in SYSIN by using the CHUNKSIZE=nnnnn keyword,
               starting in column 1.  All data folding is now done
               by a sub-program called FOLDEM, which is driven by a
               control block called FLDAREA.  See the code for
               details.

Revision  07/28/05

  VTT2TAPE  -  Put in ASG enhancement to allow a volser change
   1.13        through a PARM='TVOL=nwvser', or
               PARM='TVOL(nwvser)'.  When entering the new volser
               this way, I put in a check for short volsers (less
               than 6 characters) and ran the volser from the PARM
               through a translate table first, to uppercase it
               and clean it up somewhat.  The volser that is coded
               in the SYSIN DD card can completely override this,
               so you still have the freedom to create bizarre
               volsers if you really want to.  BTW, you do not
               need to code the new volser in the JCL.  This
               program does not do a RDJFCB to find out what is in
               the JCL.

Revision  12/12/04

  VTT2TAPE  -  Fixed the program logic to be able to read an AWS
   1.12        tape file with "short chunks".  Included the UNFOLDEM
               program to do all data moves from the folded FB-80
               AWS-format file, to the data buffer.  So this logic
               has been completely removed from the VTT2TAPE main
               program.  The UNFOLDEM program is driven by the
               contents of a control block called UNFAREA.  See the
               program code itself for further explanation.

  VTT2FK2T  -  This is a new program, modeled after the current
   1.12        version of VTT2TAPE, which reads a FLEX-ES FAKETAPE
               file, folded into FB-80 format on any MVS system,
               and writes a real tape on a real (or virtual) tape
               drive, from the FAKETAPE file data.

Revision  07/22/03

  VTT2TAPE  -  Added optional SYSIN ddname to be able to change
   1.10        the volser of the output tape.  Code as follows:

               //SYSIN DD *
               NEWVOL=volser     (has to start in column 1)
               /*

  VTT2DISK  -  Added parameter IDRCOFF.  If this is coded, then
   1.10        VTT2DISK turns off the IDRC indicators in the output
               AWS tape file.  These are in the VOL1 label, and the
               HDR2, EOF2, EOV2 labels.

Revision  12/11/02

  VTT2CNVU  -  Changed trailer characters to fill out the FB-80
   1.1         fixed records, from x'20' to x'00' as per request
               from Reed Petty, and the discussion of the Hercules
               forum.

Revision  12/10/02

  VTT2DISK  -  Changed trailer characters to fill out the FB-80
   1.11        fixed records, from x'20' to x'00' as per request
               from Reed Petty, and the discussion of the Hercules
               forum.
